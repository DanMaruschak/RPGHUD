    <title>RPG HUD - A heads-up display for playing RPGs via video chat</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <img src="./documentation-images/RPGHUDforOBSscreenshot.PNG" width=500/>
    <p>This is RPGHUD, a dice-rolling app that overlays your video feed for use
    playing RPGs over video chat. The idea is that you can be "heads up"
    looking at the other players (and their dice-results) and not down at a
    map-based virtual tabletop. This version is meant to work with
    <a href=https://obsproject.com/>OBS<a>, the software used by most videogame
    streamers, which can composite video and output to a "virtual camera" that
    can be used by a video chat app like Zoom.</p>

    <p>This is currently in alpha-testing. You can use it, and I'll endeavor
    to keep it functional, but I can't promise there are zero bugs. If you
    have feedback (either bug reports or more general stuff) I'm open to
    hearing it (I have a firstname.lastname style gmail adress, or find
    me on twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/DanMaruschak">@DanMaruschak</a>).</p>

    <p>To use it, you'll need to download <a href=https://obsproject.com/>OBS<a>
    if you haven't already, and then set up a scene.</p>

    <p>1. You'll probably want to set up a "profile" to use with a virtual camera,
    since you'll probably want to use a different resolution than you would for
    streaming or recording videos.</p>
    <p>2. Create a scene for your RPGHUD output.</p>
    <p>3. Add a "Browser" source to the scene for the RPGHUD Display Panel.
      <br>URL: https://danmaruschak.github.io/RPGHUD/obsdisplay.html
      <br>Width: 1280
      <br>Height: 720</p>
    <p>4. Add a second "Browser" source for the RPGHUD Control Panel.
      <br>URL: https://danmaruschak.github.io/RPGHUD/rpghud.html
      <br>Width: 300
      <br>Height: 850</p>

    <p>5. Add a "Video Capture Device" for your webcam.<p>
    <img src="./documentation-images/MakeWebcamSource.PNG"/>
    <p>6. If necessary, resize and reposition the output of your webcam in the
    scene so goes from the top to the bottom and is centered in the scene.</p>
    <p>7. If necessary, resize the "display" source to cover 100% of the scene.</p>
    <p>8. Reposition the "control" source so that it's offscreen or hidden
    behind your camera output (it needs to be included in the scene so the
    javascript that controls it can communicate with the javascript in the
    display panel, but you don't want it to actually be seen by the other
    participants).</p>
    <p>9. Order the sources so the Display is on top (so the dice can be seen),
    your webcam next, then control (so it can be hidden behind you camera).</p>
    <img src="./documentation-images/sources.PNG"/>
    <p>10. Right-click on the "Control" source and select "Interact". This will
    pop up a window which lets you use the controls in the control panel to
    roll dice. Resize this to be a tall, narrow window that you can have off to
    the side while you're using your video chat.</p>
    <img src="./documentation-images/InteractWithControlPanel.PNG" height=400/>
    <p>11. Now you can press the "Start Virtual Camera" button, which will let
    you add the virtual camera as an input to a video chat program like Zoom.
    (Unfortunately minimizing the OBS window also minimizes the control panel
    interact window, but you can hide the OBS window behind your video chat app
    or reposition the window so it's mostly offscreen).</p>
    <img src="./documentation-images/ZoomSettings.PNG" width=500/>
    <p>12. You might want to turn off "Mirror My Video" in the Zoom settings.
    Apps like Zoom know that humans are only used to seeing themselves when they
    look in a mirror, if it showed you what the camera was actually showing
    to the rest of the world you would look "weird" to yourself, so when you
    see your own video feed in the app it usually does a left-right flip like
    what happens when you look in a mirror. But with the dice overlayed the
    numbers will look backwards to you. For the most part you'll be interacting
    with your own dice in the control panel window so it won't matter what your
    dice look like to you in your video feed, but seeing backwards numbers can
    be uncomfortable (but so can seeing non-backwards video of yourself, so
    you need to pick which one is least bad for you). Even when your video is
    mirrored for you the app doesn't mirror what it sends out to the other
    participants in the call, so the numbers they see on the dice won't be
    backwards.</p>
    <p>13. This isn't obvious, but if you go to the "configuration" pane in the
    controls page, if you right-click on the dice controls it brings up a popup
    menu that lets you select some pre-set autoconfigurations for some indie RPG
    classics like <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i> and <i>My Life with Master</i>.
